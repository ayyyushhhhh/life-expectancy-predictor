**About the project**

[The Life Expectancy (WHO) dataset on Kaggle was created by Kumar Rajarshi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). It contains data on life expectancy, health factors, and economic factors for 193 countries from 2000 to 2015. The goal of the project is to use this data to study the factors that influence life expectancy and to develop models that can predict life expectancy.

**Goal of the project**

The goal of the project is to use statistical analysis to discover factors influencing life expectancy. The specific objectives of the project are to:

* Identify the most important factors that influence life expectancy.
* Develop models that can predict life expectancy.
* Use the models to identify countries that are at risk of having low life expectancy.

**Columns of the data**

The dataset contains the following columns:

* Country: The name of the country.
* Year: The year of the observation.
* Status: The development status of the country (developed or developing).
* Life expectancy: The average life expectancy in the country in that year.
* Adult mortality: The number of deaths per 1,000 adults in the country in that year.
* Infant deaths: The number of deaths per 1,000 live births in the country in that year.
* Under-5 deaths: The number of deaths per 1,000 live births in the country in that year.
* Immunization coverage: The percentage of children in the country who have been immunized against polio, hepatitis B, measles, and diphtheria.
* Alcohol consumption: The average daily consumption of alcohol per adult in the country in liters.
* HIV/AIDS: The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the country in that year.
* BMI: The average BMI of adults in the country in that year.
* Thinness: The prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents in the country in that year.
